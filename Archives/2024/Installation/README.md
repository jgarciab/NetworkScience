Before arriving at Utrecht please install the following software:
- [R and RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Anaconda (Python)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

Please update R and Anaconda if you have them installed but you haven’t updated them in the last 6—12 months. 

Please test that your installation works by downloading the two files in this folder.
- For R, open `test_R.Rmd` with RStudio and try to run it.
- For Python, open JupyterLab (using the Anaconda Navigator), then navigate to the location of `test_Python.ipynb` to open it and try to run it.


In case you encounter problems, please contact [Javier Garcia-Bernardo](mailto:javier.uu@proton.me).



TODO:
For next year, ask participants to install the environment beforehand
